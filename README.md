# MARBLE 

**A web app for students to improve their programming skills through challenging exercises**

Marble is a web application where users can exercise and improve their skills in a sequence of challenging activities and tutorials regarding the specificities of some libraries and the components used to build a real-world REST APIs. 

Marble was built with React, Express & Postgres, as a Final Project of IT students at CCT - College of Computing Technology (Dublin Irelend).

# Preface

-   **Background**: We noticed that for some students learn how to build a RESTful API can be demanding and overwhelming as the requirements to build a well-structured and documented project are quite high.
-   **Problem Context**: Since students can have different problems during their learning process, lecturers need to be adaptive when teaching using different strategies to keep them engaged during the classes and to improve their learning outcomes. One of the main challenges is to design exercises with the right amount of sharpness to ensure that everyone can follow the content that it is being transmitted while being relevant and pushing enough to prepare them to the job market.
-   **Solution**: A web application where users can exercise and improve their skills in a sequence of challenging activities and tutorials regarding the specificities of some libraries and the components used to build a real-world REST APIs.

## Overview

Our mission is to make it easier for students.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a web application capable of evaluating server-side code provided by a user as an attempt to solve proposed challenges while presenting relevant feedback about the user progression.

## Features

Here are the full lists of feature we have implemented throughout the project execution, based on research and our goals.

-   Landing page
-   Tutorials page
-   Login/Register
-   User Dashboard
    -   Edit details
    -   Users Rank
    -   Challanges List
-   Challanges page

## Future ideas

- Support videos and Audios to the explanatory content of challenges
- Reset password page
- Support to challanges be solved as a team/group.
- Chat / Social Media integration
